      <h2 id="django">When Python Became Real: My Journey Through Django</h2>
      <h5>Late May 2025</h5>
      <img src="../../static/images/img_mountains.jpg" alt="Mountains representing learning curves" width="300" height="200">
      <p>I didn’t learn Python by reading syntax — I learned it by building with Django.</p>
      <p>Outside of class, I took on real projects with tools like Whitenoise and Pillow, 
        and that hands-on experience forced me to understand data structures, views, models, and routing logic. 
        Django’s modularity trained me to think in clean sections. It was in those first days that I stopped thinking like a student and started thinking like a developer.</p>

      <h2 id="flask">Flask First, Django Clearer: Learning Through Contrast</h2>
      <h5>June 2025</h5>
      <img src="../../static/images/img_lights.jpg" alt="Northern Lights symbolizing discovery" width="300" height="200">
      <p>With the class shifting towards Flask, it felt like the training wheels came off.</p>
      <p>Unlike Django, Flask doesn’t hand you a structure — you build it from scratch. 
        And that forced me to re-create the MVT pattern, route my pages manually, and manage my own layout logic. 
        Ironically, that’s what made Django click for me. By modeling Django’s behavior in Flask, I finally understood how web apps fit together. 
        The freedom in Flask sharpened my discipline.</p>

      <h2 id="structure">Django Made My Frontend Smarter</h2>
      <h5>Mid June 2025</h5>
      <img src="../../static/images/img_forest.jpg" alt="Forest symbolizing code organization" width="300" height="200">
      <p>I remember staring my Frontend project thinking, “this is messy.”</p>
      <p>The image files, the HTML files, the CSS — everything felt cluttered. 
        So I applied my Flask's folder design (inspired by Django) to pure Frontend development: 
        I built <code>static/</code> and <code>templates/</code> folders just like I would in Flask or Django. 
        That step made my HTML modular. I realized my static assets should be organized for scale. 
        Even though I wasn’t yet using Jinja, I knew that structure would carry over when Flask arrived. 
        I am no longer just designing — I am architecting.</p>

      <h2 id="css">How Java and Flask Pushed Me to Respect CSS</h2>
      <h5>Early July 2025</h5>
      <img src="../../static/images/img_lights.jpg" alt="Light emerging as clarity in code structure" width="300" height="200">
      <p>I used to use internal CSS out of comfort — I liked seeing everything together.</p>
      <p>But something shifted. I was deep into Flask (even though the class isn't yet), and starting Java, and I realized: 
        separation of concern matters. I tested pulling styles into a <code>main.css</code> file and expected chaos… but nothing broke. 
        And that was liberating. I saw how each page could reference its own stylesheet, 
        just like methods in Java can live inside different packages.</p>

      <h2 id="java">Crossing Over: How Java Helped Me Embrace Ultra Modularity</h2>
      <h5>Mid July 2025</h5>
      <img src="../../static/images/img_forest.jpg" alt="Forest representing structure and separation" width="300" height="200">
      <p>Java isn’t just another language — it helped me embrace modular thinking on another level.</p>
      <p>As I learned about classes, packages, and calling methods from other files, 
        I started recognizing that structure in Python modules, my Flask layouts and even my frontend files. 
        My understanding of routing, templates, CSS separation — all of it snapped together. 
        Django gave me perspective and tools, Flask gave me the freedom to build, and Java gave me the push to stop clinging to clutter. 
        Now everything has its place. And I’m building bigger because of it.</p>
